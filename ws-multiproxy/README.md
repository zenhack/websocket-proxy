Using one instance of websocket-proxy per URL, and having to configure a
client to talk to each one individually. Is a bit annoying. The tool in
this directory acts as a socks proxy, and redirects host/port combos to
websocket URLs according to a config file.

More soon, but wanted to save this before I lost it.
